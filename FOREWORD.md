# Web Scraper Implementation Challenge

## Project Overview

This project was an engaging opportunity to build a web scraper system. I found particular enjoyment in developing the scraping component, as it aligns with my previous experience in web data extraction. While my earlier work utilized `requests` with `BeautifulSoup` or `PyQuery`, I chose to explore `scrapy` for this implementation - a framework I hadn't previously used. The transition was smooth since the fundamental concepts remain similar, but `scrapy` impressively handles request management, URL navigation, and logging internally, significantly reducing the need for boilerplate code.

The hierarchical nature of the "urparts" website naturally guided the implementation toward a depth-first search traversal pattern, which proved efficient for this particular data structure.

## Implementation Decisions

With limited explicit requirements, I made several judgment calls to complete the implementation:

- **Concurrency Management**: I implemented concurrent requests but found that the default settings triggered rate limiting. After experimentation, I settled on 6 concurrent requests as an optimal balance between performance and server respect.

- **Scraper Design**: The parser functions are tailored specifically to the target website's structure. In a production environment, a more generalized approach might be warranted depending on requirements.

- **Data Storage Strategy**: The current implementation adds new scrape results to the same collection, potentially creating duplicates. I considered two alternative approaches:
  * Creating new collections for each scrape to maintain historical data
  * Implementing upsert operations with unique indexing to prevent duplication

- **Testing Approach**: I focused testing efforts on the scraper component, which contains the most significant business logic. The API layer primarily serves as a data passthrough. In my experience, web scraper testing presents unique challenges, as websites frequently change their HTML structure, potentially rendering tests obsolete quickly.

## Future Enhancements

Given additional time, I would implement several improvements:

- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Develop robust tests using mocked responses to validate parser functionality across edge cases and different data structures.

- **Asynchronous Scraping**: Refactor the scraper to utilize asynchronous programming patterns, potentially improving throughput by handling I/O operations more efficiently.

- **Resilience Features**: Implement more sophisticated retry mechanisms, proxy rotation, and user-agent cycling to improve reliability against anti-scraping measures.

- **Data Pipeline**: Create a proper ETL pipeline to process, transform, and validate the scraped data before storage.

- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Develop a monitoring interface to track scraper performance, success rates, and data quality metrics in real-time.

- **Scheduled Runs**: Implement a scheduling system (using Airflow or similar) to automate periodic scraping with configurable parameters.

- **Documentation**: Expand API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI specifications and provide comprehensive setup guides for all components.
